## Qur'an

### -quran
**-quran** allows you to quote Qur'an verses in English, with an optional translation.

```
-quran <surah>:<verse(s)> [translation]
```

For example:

```
-quran 1:1-7 khattab 
```
The above command would quote Surah 1, Verses 1-7 (Surah al-Fatihah) using the translation of Dr Mustafa Khattab.

#### Valid translations

#### -settranslation

This command allows you to change the default translation of `-quran` on your server. You must have the `Manage Server` or `Administrator` permission to use this command. 

```
-settranslation <translation>
```

For example:

```
-settranslation sahih 
```
The above command would set the default Qur'an translation to Sahih International.

### -aquran
**-aquran** functions in the same way as **-quran**, but quotes the verse in Arabic.

For example, to quote the first verse of the Qur'an:
```
-aquran 1:1
```

### -morphology
**-morphology** allows you to analyse the Arabic morphology of any word in the Qur'an.

```
-morphology surah:verse:word number
```

For example:
```
-morphology 1:2:4
```
The above would analyse the morphology of the 4th word of the 2nd verse of the 1st chapter of the Qur'an. The bot will also show the syntax of the verse the word is in, if the data is available.


### -mushaf
**-mushaf** fetches the image of the page on which a verse would be on a standard *Medina Mushaf*. 

```
-mushaf <surah>:<verse>
```

For example:
```
-mushaf 1:2
```
The above would send an image of the page containing Qur'an 1:2 on a *Medina Mushaf*. 



## Tafsir (Commentaries on the Qur'an) 

### -atafsir
**-atafsir** allows you to quote from over 26 Arabic *tafaseer* (commentaries on the Qurʾān). A list of valid *tafaseer* is available [here](https://github.com/galacticwarrior9/islambot/blob/master/Tafsir.md).

```
-atafsir <surah>:<verse(s> [tafsir]
```

For example:

```
-atafsir 2:255 tabari
```

The above command would quote the tafsir of Ayatul Kursi from Tafsir al-Tabari.


### -tafsir
**-tafsir** allows you to quote the English tasfir (commentary) of verses from Tafsīr al-Jalālayn (`jalalayn`), Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr (`ibnkathir`), Tafsīr al-Tustarī (`tustari`), Rashīd al-Dīn Maybudī's Kashf al-Asrār (`kashf`), al-Qurayshi's Laṭāʾif al-Ishārāt (`qurayshi`), Tafsīr ʿAbd al-Razzāq al-Kāshānī (`kashani`) and al-Wahidi's Asbāb al-Nuzūl (`wahidi`). It works in the same manner as **-atafsir**.

```
-tafsir <surah>:<verse> <jalalayn/ibnkathir/kashf/tustari/qurayshi/kashani/wahidi>
```

For example:

```
-tafsir 1:1 ibnkathir
```
The above command would quote the tafsir of Surah al-Fatihah, verse 1 from Tafsir Ibn Kathir. 

## Hadith 

### -hadith
**-hadith** allows you to quote hadith from sunnah.com in English.

```
-hadith <hadith book name> <chapter number>:<hadith number>
```

For example, to quote the second hadith in Chapter 1 of Sahih Bukhari:
```
-hadith bukhari 1:2
```

The above would fetch the hadith from https://sunnah.com/bukhari/1/2

Alternatively, you can simply type the sunnah.com link in chat. The bot will then send it if it is able to. 


#### Valid hadith book names 

* bukhari = Sahih Bukhari
* muslim = Sahih Muslim
* tirmidhi = Jami` at-Tirmidhi
* abudawud = Sunan Abi Dawud
* nasai = Sunan an-Nasa'i
* ibnmajah = Sunan Ibn Majah
* malik = Muwatta Malik
* riyadussaliheen = Riyad as-Salihin
* adab = Al-Adab Al-Mufrad
* bulugh = Bulugh al-Maram
* qudsi = 40 Hadith Qudsi
* nawawi = 40 Hadith Nawawi

40 Hadith Qudsi or Nawawi are both 40 hadith long respectively, and as such do not use a chapter number.

For example:
```
-hadith qudsi 32
```

Not all hadith are indexed correctly on sunnah.com, and not all use the same numbering as in the books - so please keep this in mind.

### -ahadith
**-ahadith** is the same as -hadith, but allows you to quote hadith in Arabic. 


## Prayer (Salaah) Times

The bot can also fetch the prayer times for any location. More precise locations (e.g. addresses) will yield more accurate prayer times. 

```
-prayertimes <location>
```

For example:
```
-prayertimes Burj Khalifa, Dubai
```

..would fetch prayer times in the general area of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. 


## Hijri Calendar

The bot can also (rather inaccurately) convert both ways between the Hijri and Gregorian calendars.

### -converttohijri
Converts a Gregorian date to its corresponding Hijri date.

```
-converttohijri DD-MM-YY 
```

For example:
```
-converttohijri 31-08-2017
```

### -convertfromhijri
Converts a Hijri date to its corresponding Gregorian date.

For example, to convert 17 Muharram 1407:
```
-convertfromhijri 17-01-1407
```
