# English Tafsir

The bot is able to quote from 7 *tafaseer* (commentaries on the Qurʾān) translated to English for use with the `-tafsir` command (see the [documentation](https://github.com/galacticwarrior9/islambot/blob/master/README.md)). I have attempted to add a short description to each one:

1. `jalalayn` - the tafsir of the "Two Jalals" -  a commentary written by Jalāl ad-Dīn al-Maḥalli and his student Jalāl ad-Dīn as-Suyūtī. It is known for his brevity and concision. This is the default tafsir. 
2. `ibnkathir` - the tafsir of Ibn Kathir (d. 774 AH) entitled *al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓeem*, or more simply, *Tafsir Ibn Kathir*, is a popular commentary on the Qurʾān based on Ibn Taymiyyah's exegetical style of quoting early Muslim authorities (the *salaf*).
3. `tustari` - the tafsir of Sahl al-Tustarī (d. 283 AH), a Persian Ṣūfī mystic.
